      Spelled Out with C++ 

Hello there! This is my rendition of the [Zero to Hero series with Andrej Karpathy](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ) with additional tools and all written in C++. I had a lot of fun working on this project, and I recommend anyone who is remotely interested in any of the topics to give it a whirl, this might be the best series I have followed ever.

Here I will try to summarize and document my implementations, mostly mentioning the general guidelines and the differences from his implementations. I am not an expert in C++, especially in ML topics, but I think the implementation doesn't have much imperfections; if you do have any implementation improvement suggestions please do contribute and let me know why you think the change made makes an improvement over the existing code.
